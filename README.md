# Baudot-Lorenz cipher

## Requirements
1. Python 3 (Python 3.8.3 recommended)
2. Baudot (`pip install baudot==0.1.1.post2`)

## Description

This is an experimental implementation of Lorenz cipher over Baudot encoding. I haven't added any test files. 
There will not be a proper documentation either, but the code is mostly self explanatory. 

I have used an original code base and replaced the baudot encoding part with the library

Codebase: RealGrep/ lorenz-cipher-sim (clone: https://github.com/RealGrep/lorenz-cipher-sim.git)

Replace `actual_text` with your custom text. Custom seed is used to maintain consistency in randomness. 
Change it if you want.
